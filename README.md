This work is aimed at automatically tuning a pre-trained CNN layers with the knowledge of target dataset for improved transfer learning.

Fig. Overview of the proposed method. a) Typically, the CNN models used for transferring the knowledge are initially trained over a large-scale image dataset. b) Conventionally, while transferring the learned knowledge from the source task to the target task, the last one or a few layers of the pre-trained CNN are fine-tuned over the target dataset. c) The proposed AutoTune method tunes the $k$ number of layers automatically using Bayesian Optimization \cite{frazier2018tutorial}. Note that the lock and unlock symbols are used to represent the frozen and fine-tuned layers, respectively. Finally, the tuned CNN layers can be re-trained over the target dataset for improved transfer learning. Different colors represent different CNN layers.
